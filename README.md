<h4>Background Information</h4>
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. Identifying customers who are
likely to churn is crucial for implementing proactive measures to retain them. By leveraging PySpark,
we can take advantage of its distributed computing capabilities to handle large volumes of data
efficiently and build an accurate machine learning model for churn prediction.

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using PySpark that accurately
predicts customer churn in a telecom company. The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of
0.8, enabling the company to proactively identify and retain customers at risk of leaving. By
effectively predicting churn, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce
customer attrition, and improve overall business performance.
